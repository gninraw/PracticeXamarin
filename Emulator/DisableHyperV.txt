The fastest way, possibly the only way that I have found was to, open Hyper-V manager and "stop service" on the right panel, and then at an elevated command prompt I entered what you see below.
Code:
 
Disable Hyper-v at an elevated command prompt, and reboot.
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
 
To enable Hyper-v to use Hyper-V again, at an elevated command prompt, and reboot
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
